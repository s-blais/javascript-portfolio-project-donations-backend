# README

This is the backend for my Rails/JS project to fulfill requirements for my Flatiron Full-Stack Software Engineering Program. The frontend is [here](https://github.com/s-blais/javascript-portfolio-project-transactions-frontend).

The application concept is to create a simple web interface that could be used by my client's charitable foundation to easily record and view donation history.

Developed on Ruby 2.6.1 and Rails 6.0.3.4, with PostgreSQL 12 database.
